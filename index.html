            <!-- Description -->
           <p>The almond tree (Prunus dulcis) is a medium-sized deciduous tree belonging to the rose family (Rosaceae). It is native to the Middle East and South Asia but is now widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates, such as California, Spain, and Iran. The tree grows to a height of 4 to 10 meters and develops a wide, spreading canopy. In early spring, before the leaves appear, it produces fragrant pink or white blossoms, which are important for pollinators like bees.

Almonds are actually the seeds of a drupe fruit, not true botanical nuts. The outer hull splits open when mature, revealing the hard shell that encloses the edible seed. The tree requires hot summers and cool, frost-free winters for optimal growth and fruiting. It prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and is moderately drought-tolerant once established.

Almonds are highly valued for their nutritional content, being rich in healthy fats, protein, fiber, and vitamin E. The tree plays a significant role in agriculture and the global economy, especially in countries where almonds are a major export crop. With proper care, almond trees can live and produce fruit for 30 to 50 years.
